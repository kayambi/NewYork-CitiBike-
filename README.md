# NewYork-CitiBike-

analyzing City Bike for the [New York Citi Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike) Program, in this projet we will generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.



Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. In this project we will answer a number of questions on the program, out Task is to Build a set of data reports to provide the answers.
 

## Task

* to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to build a data dashboard, story, or report.by working  with a timespan of our choice. we can merge multiple datasets from different periods. The following are some questions that we are going to tackle,

* How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?

* By what percentage has total ridership grown? 

* How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months? 

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?

* How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?

* How does the average trip duration change by age?

* What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?

* Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan? 

* How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

** Prove the following visualizations:**

* A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.


**Lastly, as a chronic over-achiever:**

* Find at least two unexpected phenomena in the data and provide a visualization and analysis to document their presence. 

## Considerations

Keeping in mind that people reading analysis may not be data analysts. Let's say audience will be  the city officials, public administrators, and heads of New York City departments. the data and analysis needs to be presented in a way that is focused, concise, easy-to-understand, and visually compelling.visualizations should be colorful enough to be included in press releases, and our analysis should be thoughtful enough for dictating programmatic changes. 

## Assessment

final product will be assessed on the following metrics: 

* Analytic Rigor

* Readability

* Visual Attraction
